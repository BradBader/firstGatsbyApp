#Borderlands 3 is slightly better than Meh.
The framerate is somewhat unacceptable on PS4 Pro.  It's not playable in the visual mode.  Even in performance mode, the framerate drops significantly under load.  In performance mode thr graphics are a little on the trash side.  The gameplay is not unique or innovative.  It's boring and shitty solo.
